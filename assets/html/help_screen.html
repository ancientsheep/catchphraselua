<h1>Hot Potato</h1>

<h2>The Basics:</h2>
GAMENAME is a fast paced, word-guessing showdown between two teams. Players take turns passing the device & giving clues in order to help teammates guess mystery words & phrases before the timer runs out. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game, wins.<br><br>


<h2>Classic Mode (Hot Potato)</h2>

Overview:<br>
Players take turns passing the device & giving clues in order to help teammates guess mystery words & phrases before the timer runs out. Whichever team isn't stuck holding the device when the buzzer goes off scores a point. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game, wins.<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>Pass after a single, correct answer</li>
	<li>Only Team members guess</li>
	<li>Points awarded for not getting stuck with the device</li>
	<li>High Score wins</li>
</ul>

<b>Set-up:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Divide players into two even teams.</li>
	<li>Sit in a circle so everyone is sitting next to a member of the opposite team. (ex: A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B)</li>
</ul>


<b>Options:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Enter team names (if desired)</li>
	<li>Choose and "end game" conditionâ€”either rounds or points.</li>
	<li>Choose an approximate timer length.</li>
	<li>Select number of times a player is allowed to skip a word per turn.</li>
	<li>Finally, select the category or categories the group wants to play during this game session.</li>
	<li>Press "Play" to progress to the opening</li>
	<li>You may give a team a "handicap" by altering the score here if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<b>Gameplay:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Randomly choose a player to go first.</li>
	<li>A game typically consists of multiple rounds.</li>
	<li>Press "Start Round" to begin.</li>
	<li>A word or phrase will appear on screen & a timer will begin counting down.</li>
	<li>Get your team to guess the words by giving verbal & gestural clues. Only your team should guess.</li>
	<li>If you're stuck on a word, you may choose to "skip," assuming your group allowed for skips during game set-up.</li>
	<li>As soon as your teammates guess the correct answer, carefully hand the device to the next player of the opposing team (Never throw or toss the device).</li>
	<li>Play continues with the new player pressing the "next" button.</li>
	<li>Players continue this process until the buzzer sounds & flashes on screen.  The timer is slightly randomized, so there's no telling exactly when it will go off.</li>
	<li>Whichever team isn't in possession of the device when the buzzer sound gets 1 point.  (Note a device is considered "handed off" as soon as it touches the hands of the next player).</li>
	<li>That team also gets a single chance to guess the mystery phrase if it hasn't yet been said aloud (they may discuss it briefly first). If they guess correctly, the team also receives 1 bonus point, for a total of 2 points. The losing team awards these points.</li>
	<li>The next round begins with whoever was holding the device when the previous round ended.</li>
	<li>Play continues until the victory condition of the game is met.  At that point, the team with the highest score wins.</li>
</ul>

<b>The Clue Giver Cannot:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Say a word that rhymes with the word
	<li>Spell out any part of the word
	<li>Give "Sounds like" clues
	<li>Say any word or phrase on the screen unless a teammate says it first.
	<li>Skip a word using the "next" button.
	<li>Throw, Toss, or Slide the device to another player.
</ul>


If the other team catches you doing any of the things listed above, immediately pause the game, "end round," and manually award the other team a single point.  Then proceed to the next round.

If a scoring error is made, players can manually adjust the score at any point between rounds.
